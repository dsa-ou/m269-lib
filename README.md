This library aims to provide simple, readable and documented implementations
of commonly taught data structures and algorithms (DSA).
It was created for M269, our DSA course, but we hope it's of use by other courses.

The current version implements
- bags (multisets), with a Python dictionary
- queues, with Python lists and linked lists
- stacks, Python lists and linked lists.

The library uses a small subset of Python's language and standard library,
to make it easier to understand.

All modules, classes and methods have docstrings.
All classes have usage examples.
All methods indicate their worst-case complexity.

For installation and usage instructions,
see the [documentation](https://dsa-ou.github.io/m269-lib).
